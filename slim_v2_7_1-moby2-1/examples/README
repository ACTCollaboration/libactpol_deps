This directory contains some example projects where a new binary is
built using the slimlib library.

The command-line slim binary is suitable only for the simplest of
binary files.  The binary cannot compress files containing channels
with more than one size, any complicated repetition pattern, or any
kind of file header.  For such files, you'll have to write a new
binary that's aware of the files' specifics.

Directories:

* ljhslim - slims raw microcalorimeter data files of the "LJH" type.
