This application is used to make reversible, lossless compression of
noisy science data.  

It is appropriate to use the binaries slim, unslim, and slimcat for
data streams consisting of one or more "channels" of binary integer
data packed into a repeating pattern of words 1, 2, or 4 bytes in
length.

In addition to the binaries, the package provides a library with C
linkage for READING slim files with an interface that tracks the usual
stdio binary interface as much as possible.  Thus
slimopen("file.slm","r") returns a SLIMFILE* object.  Other methods
include slimread(), slimclose(), slimseek(), slimtell().  Use the
library by linking with "-lslim" and also #include <slimlib.h>.

Slim currently does not support 8-byte integers.  Floating-point
numbers are not really supported, though slim will do its best by
pretending they are integers.  See the file TODO.

When installing, use ./configure --prefix=/usr/ or similar if you do
not have /usr/local/bin in your path and /usr/local/lib in your
library path.
