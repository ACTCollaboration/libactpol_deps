Slim currently does not support 8-byte integer data.  Only 1, 2, or 4
byte raw data can be compressed.

Floating-point numbers are not really supported, though slim will do
its best for 4-byte floats by pretending they are integers.  The
author hopes to improve the behavior with floating-point numbers in
the future.

The library interface currently allows reading, but not writing, slim
data.  The author would like to add a writing feature, but he is stuck
on the issue of how to inform the object of all the facts it needs
about the planned channels and their properties.  A possible first
step is to allow writing of one-channel data files only.
